<h1>News-Compare</h1>

<p>
In this quiz, you'll read some quotes from articles </br> 
about <strong>education</strong> from various news sources. </br>
Try and guess who said the quote and see how </br> good you 
are at determining bias out of context. </br>
The quotes chosen are meant to be intentionally vague </br>
</br>
This is meant to be a test of exposure. Do you read</br>
multiple news sources? Do you know your own biases?</br>
Are you a victim of <em>echo chambering</em>?</br>
</p>

<h2>Good Luck and Happy Reading!</h2>
