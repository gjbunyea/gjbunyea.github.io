<h2>Quote 1</h2>
<p>
Nobody mandates that you take an Uber over a taxi, nor should they. But if you think</br> 
ridesharing is the best option for you, the government shouldn’t get in your way.</p>

<h2>Quote 2</h2>
<p>
To rule against the Blaine Amendments would open the door to subsidizing religious</br> 
schools with public dollars. On many occasions, voucher advocates have asked voters</br>
to repeal their state’s Blaine amendment to allow vouchers for religious schools,</br>
and in every state, voters said no. Betsy DeVos and her husband sponsored a refer-</br> 
endum in Michigan in 2000 to roll back that state’s ban on vouchers, and voters</br>
rejected their proposal overwhelmingly.

<h2>Quote 3</h2>
<p>
..Making matters slightly worse, in DeVos’ model, even if your child or children </br>
can pass the exams and meet the private school’s related standards, the voucher </br>
DeVos would hand you may not cover the full cost of tuition – which means you’d be</br>
headed back to the public school system that would suddenly have many of its best </br>
students taken away as a result of the privatization/choice scheme.
